   specified, or call vTaskDelay()). If the application makes use of the
   vTaskDelete() API function (as this demo application does) then it is also

   pvPortMalloc() is called internally by the kernel whenever a task, queue,
   timer or semaphore is created. It is also called by various parts of the
   demo application. If heap_1.c or heap_2.c are used, then the size of the
   heap available to pvPortMalloc() is defined by configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE in
   FreeRTOSConfig.h, and the xPortGetFreeHeapSize() API function can be used
   to query the size of free heap space that remains (although it does not
   provide information on how the remaining heap might be fragmented). */
